Documentation
=============
This documentation can be used to get an insight into the input format and the operation of UnCo.
In addition, instructions are included on how to run the benchmark tests performed in the master thesis and how the benchmark can be extended with own models and SPARQL queries.
These can be customized so that the benchmark can be repeated with other data sets or other parameters.
